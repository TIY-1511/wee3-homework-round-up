# wee3-homework-round-up

This repo contains reminders about previous homework.

It is up to you on where you would like to spend your time:

Project Invoice - https://github.com/TIY-1511/classes_homework#5-project-invoice

This focussed on classes   
These are the building bloacks on any Ruby application. The more comfortable you are with classes the better.


Arrays and Hashes - https://github.com/TIY-1511/arrays_and_hashes/blob/master/tests.rb

Being comfortable with arrays will help you a lot when we move onto Rails. We will be dealing with lists of objects, that come from the database


SQL and HTML - https://github.com/TIY-1511/sql_html/blob/master/README.md#homework

I have added a new homework section here. While these topics are important, we will be covering them in the context of Rails in the upcoming weeks.
