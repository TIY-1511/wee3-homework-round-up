# wee3-homework-round-up

This repo contains reminders about previous homework.

It is up to you on where you would like to spend your time:

### Project Invoice  
https://github.com/TIY-1511/classes_homework#5-project-invoice

This focussed on classes   
These are the building bloacks on any Ruby application. The more comfortable you are with classes the better.

### Arrays and Hashes
https://github.com/TIY-1511/arrays_and_hashes/blob/master/tests.rb

Being comfortable with arrays will help you a lot when we move onto Rails. We will be dealing with lists of objects, that come from the database

### SQL and HTML
https://github.com/TIY-1511/sql_html/blob/master/README.md#homework

I have added a new homework section here. While these topics are important, we will be covering them in the context of Rails in the upcoming weeks. 

### Black Jack (API practice)

If you would like to gain experience using APIs then this is for you. Make a Black Jack game that uses the Deck of Cards API - http://deckofcardsapi.com/

### API and ERB
Use the Deck of Cards API and ERB to create a web page that shows 10 random cards. 

This is not as hard as you may think, shout if you get stuck.

### Rock Paper Scissors (SQL, ERB)

Implement a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Store each round and the result in a database row. After each game, generate an HTML report which shows the games played so far e.g. the computers choice, players choice, game result.
